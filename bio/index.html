  <p class="readable">My name is Drew Powers, and I&rsquo;m a 23.1-year-old artist from Orlando, FL.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:40px;">I went to school for studio art. My focus was in painting, but I&rsquo;m also trained in drawing, printmaking, art history, and a little bit of book production. In between classes I have worked as a freelance graphic designer and web coder for different companies and individuals around Orlando. For the past year, I've worked at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111015074023/http://kmdg.com/" target="_blank">Kammel+Morgan Design Group</a> doing the same things.</p>
  <p class="readable">I am equally fascinated with aesthetics and efficiency.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:40px;">I believe in the harmony of form and function, and I believe beauty exists just as much in the internal mechanisms of the device as its casing. To me, &ldquo;design&rdquo; encompasses a lot more than mindlessly making shapes in Photoshop, and when making websites my code is just as meticulously drafted as the visuals that adorn it.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">I take a personal interest in my clients and the work I do. Whatever questions you may have, I&rsquo;d be glad to answer.</p>
